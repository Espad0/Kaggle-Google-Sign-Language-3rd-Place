# Technical Deep Dive - ASL Fingerspelling Recognition

## Architecture Overview

This document provides an in-depth technical explanation of the 3rd place solution for the ASL Fingerspelling Recognition competition.

## 1. Data Pipeline & Preprocessing

### 1.1 Landmark Extraction Strategy

The solution uses MediaPipe landmarks with intelligent selection:

```python
# Key landmark indices
LIPS = 56 facial landmarks around mouth region
LEFT_HAND = 21 hand keypoints (indices 468-489)
RIGHT_HAND = 21 hand keypoints (indices 522-543)
POSE = 8 upper body joints
EYES = 32 eye contour points
```

### 1.2 Preprocessing Layers

Multiple preprocessing strategies were implemented as TensorFlow layers:

#### Standard Preprocessing (PreprocessLayerV0)
- Reference point normalization using stable landmarks
- Dominant hand detection based on non-NaN frame counts
- Automatic mirroring for left-handed signers
- Dynamic padding/downsampling to fixed sequence length

#### Pose-Enhanced Preprocessing (PreprocessLayerV0Pose)
- Includes upper body pose landmarks
- Mirrors pose landmarks for left/right consistency
- Maintains spatial relationships during normalization

#### Eyes-Aware Preprocessing (PreprocessLayerV0Eyes)
- Incorporates eye landmarks for facial expressions
- Sparse variant samples every other landmark for efficiency

### 1.3 Frame Normalization Algorithm

```python
# 1. Extract reference landmarks for stability
ref_landmarks = [nose, shoulders, mouth_center]

# 2. Calculate global statistics excluding NaN values
mean = nanmean(ref_landmarks)
std = nanstd(ref_landmarks)

# 3. Normalize all landmarks
normalized = (landmarks - mean) / std

# 4. Handle missing data
normalized = where(isnan(normalized), 0.0, normalized)
```

## 2. Feature Engineering

### 2.1 Motion Features

Motion features capture temporal dynamics:

```python
# Frame-to-frame differences
motion = frames[t] - frames[t-1]

# Motion magnitude
motion_dist = sqrt(mean(motion^2, axis=-1))

# Combined motion vector [dx, dy, magnitude]
motion_features = concat([motion, motion_dist], axis=-1)
```

### 2.2 Landmark-Specific Processing

Different body parts receive specialized treatment:

1. **Lips**: 56 landmarks → 112D feature vector
2. **Hands**: 21 landmarks → 42D feature vector  
3. **Pose**: 8 landmarks → 16D feature vector
4. **Motion**: 106 landmarks → 318D feature vector

## 3. Model Architectures

### 3.1 Transformer Architecture

Custom implementation for TFLite compatibility:

```python
class MultiHeadAttention:
    - Separate Q, K, V projections per head
    - Scaled dot-product attention
    - Concatenated multi-head output
    - Final linear projection

class TransformerBlock:
    - LayerNorm → MultiHeadAttention → Residual
    - LayerNorm → MLP → Residual
    - Late dropout scheduling
```

Key innovations:
- **Landmark-specific embeddings** with learnable weights
- **Positional encoding** based on non-empty frame indices
- **Adaptive pooling** using attention masks

### 3.2 Conv1D Architecture

Efficient architecture using depthwise separable convolutions:

```python
Sequential([
    Reshape((1, 32, 256)),
    Conv2D(256, 1) → BatchNorm → DepthwiseConv2D → BatchNorm,
    MaxPool2D((1,2)),
    Conv2D(256, 1) → BatchNorm → DepthwiseConv2D → BatchNorm,
    Conv2D(256, 1) → BatchNorm → DepthwiseConv2D(depth_mult=4),
    GlobalAvgPool2D(),
    Dense(768) → BatchNorm → Dropout,
    Dense(768) → BatchNorm → Dropout,
    Dense(250, activation='softmax')
])
```

### 3.3 Ensemble Strategy

The final prediction combines multiple models:

```python
# Transformer ensemble (3 models)
transformer_avg = mean([trans_1, trans_2, trans_3])

# Final weighted combination
output = 0.2 * conv1d_lips + 
         0.2 * conv1d_standard +
         0.3 * conv1d_pose +
         0.3 * conv1d_motion +
         0.3 * conv1d_eyes +
         0.3 * conv1d_sparse +
         1.5 * transformer_avg
```

## 4. Training Techniques

### 4.1 Optimization Strategy
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with weight decay (1e-5)
- **Learning rate**: 1e-3 with warmup
- **Gradient clipping**: norm=1.0
- **Label smoothing**: Reduces overconfidence

### 4.2 Data Augmentation
- Time-based augmentation (stretching/compression)
- Spatial augmentation (shearing)
- Random frame dropping
- Noise injection for robustness

### 4.3 Cross-Validation
- 5-fold stratified split
- Group-based splitting to prevent data leakage
- Ensemble predictions from all folds

## 5. Model Optimization & Deployment

### 5.1 TensorFlow Lite Conversion

```python
# Custom TFLite module
class TFLiteModel(tf.Module):
    @tf.function(input_signature=[...])
    def __call__(self, inputs):
        # All preprocessing inside the model
        # Efficient inference path
        return {'outputs': predictions}

# Conversion with optimization
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
converter.target_spec.supported_types = [tf.float16]
```
