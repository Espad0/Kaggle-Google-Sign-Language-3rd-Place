# 🥉 3rd Place Solution - Google ASL Fingerspelling Recognition Competition

## Overview

This repository contains the 3rd place solution developed by our team for the [Google - Isolated Sign Language](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asl-signs/overview) competition on Kaggle. The challenge involved building a model to recognize Isolated Sign Language (ISL) gestures from video sequences captured via MediaPipe landmarks.

## Problem Statement

The competition challenged participants to build a computer vision system capable of recognizing isolated sign language gestures in real-world conditions. 

**Technical challenges:**

- Different durations for each gesture
- Missing/incomplete data, frequent landmark occlusions
- Tensorflow Lite models for mobile devices with 40MB size limit
- 250+ gesture classes including letters, numbers, and common signs

## Solution Architecture

### 🏗️ Model Ensemble Strategy

Our 3rd place solution leverages a sophisticated multi-model ensemble combining custom Transformer and Conv1D architectures:

1. **Transformer Models** (3 variants with 5-fold cross-validation)
   - Custom MultiHeadAttention implementation specifically designed for TFLite compatibility
   - Separate embeddings for lips (256 units), hands (256 units), pose (256 units), and motion (128 units)
   - Late dropout with adaptive scheduling (starts at epoch 80)
   - Positional encoding normalized by frame indices

2. **Conv1D Models** (7 specialized variants)
   - Depthwise separable convolutions with depth multipliers 1-4x
   - Multiple preprocessing strategies:
     - **V0**: Base model with lips (40 points) + hands (21 points each)
     - **V0Pose**: Adds 12 pose landmarks for body context
     - **V0Eyes**: Incorporates 32 eye landmarks for facial expressions
     - **V0EyesSparse**: Uses every 2nd eye landmark for efficiency
   - Strategic batch normalization after each conv layer

### 🔧 Key Technical Innovations

#### 1. Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
# Landmark extraction strategy (543 total landmarks -> 106 selected)
LIPS: 40 carefully selected mouth landmarks
LEFT_HAND: 21 MediaPipe hand keypoints
RIGHT_HAND: 21 MediaPipe hand keypoints  
POSE: 8 upper body joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips)
EYES: 32 eye contour points (16 per eye)

# Hand dominance detection and mirroring
- Automatic detection of dominant hand per video
- Mirror transformation for left-handed signers
- Ensures consistent feature representation
```

#### 2. Intelligent Frame Sampling
- **Fixed 32-frame sequences** for consistent input size
- **Adaptive downsampling** for videos > 32 frames:
  - Random frame selection weighted by hand visibility
  - Preserves frames with clear hand gestures
- **Smart padding** for videos < 32 frames:
  - Edge padding with random offset to prevent overfitting
  - NaN masking for missing landmarks

#### 3. Motion Feature Engineering
```python
# Compute frame-to-frame differences
motion = frames[t] - frames[t-1]
# Add motion magnitude as additional channel
motion_dist = sqrt(mean(motion^2))
# 106 landmarks × 3 channels (dx, dy, magnitude)
```

#### 4. Landmark-Specific Embeddings with Attention
- Each landmark group has dedicated embedding network
- **Learnable soft attention weights** combine features:
  ```python
  weights = softmax([w_lips, w_hands, w_pose])
  combined = weights[0]*lips + weights[1]*hands + weights[2]*pose
  ```
- Empty landmark handling with trainable embeddings

#### 5. Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)
```python
# Each Conv1D model uses dual preprocessing at inference:
x = preprocess_layer[0](inputs)  # Standard preprocessing
x1 = preprocess_layer[1](inputs) # With random frame sampling (r_long=True)
outputs = 0.5*model(x) + 0.5*model(x1)  # Average predictions

# TTA strategies:
- Random frame sampling for long videos
- Random padding offsets for short videos
- Ensures robust predictions across video variations
```

#### 6. Optimized Model Ensemble
```python
# Final ensemble with carefully tuned weights
outputs = 0.2*model_96frames +      # Long sequence model
          0.2*model_32frames +       # Base Conv1D
          0.3*model_32pose +         # With pose landmarks
          0.3*model_32eyes +         # With eye tracking
          0.3*model_frankv2 +        # Enhanced preprocessing
          0.3*model_mu0 +            # Zero-mean normalization
          1.5*transformer_ensemble   # Main transformer models
```

### 📊 Data Augmentation Strategies

#### Training-Time Augmentations
1. **Hand Mirroring**
   - Automatic left/right hand detection per video
   - Horizontal flip transformation matrix for left-handed signers
   - Ensures model learns both hand orientations

2. **Frame-Level Augmentations**
   - **Random padding offsets**: For videos < 32 frames, random positioning within padded sequence
   - **Dynamic frame sampling**: Weighted selection based on hand visibility for videos > 32 frames
   - **Late dropout scheduling**: Starts at epoch 80 to prevent early overfitting

3. **Normalization Strategies**
   - **Per-video normalization**: Using reference landmarks (shoulders, nose, eyes)
   - **Zero-mean variants**: Some models trained with μ=0 normalization
   - **Local statistics**: Separate normalization for each landmark group

4. **CutMix Augmentation** (Custom Implementation)
   - Mixed samples from different sign language classes
   - **Weighted label assignment**:
     - Hand landmarks: 0.7 weight (primary signal)
     - Other landmarks (lips, pose): 0.3 weight (context)
   - Helps model learn robust features across different signers

#### Test-Time Augmentations (TTA)
- **Dual preprocessing paths** with 50/50 averaging
- **Random frame sampling** (r_long=True) vs deterministic sampling
- **Multiple landmark configurations** (with/without eyes, sparse landmarks)
